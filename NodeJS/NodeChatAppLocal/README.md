- nodemon ( run "npm install -g nodemon" command to install it once you have node )

How to run :

2. run following command > nodemon server.js

Result : 
server.js will be run and chat server will start on localhost:3000. 
You can type name and message in the input and send it... It will appear in the bottom chat history
You can open multiple instances of localhost in different tabs and act like diferent users, they all will sync with each other.
